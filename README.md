# Introduction to Rust: From Zero to Crate in Sixty Minutes

A talk given at Desert Code Camp in October 2018, focusing on what Rust is, what differentiates it from other languages, and key takeaways for developers who want to learn from Rust, even if they don't end up using it (specifically, ownership is incredibly powerful and you should reason about data ownership in your language of choice).

Example code is tested to work on Rust 1.29.1.

The slides are written for [mdp](https://github.com/visit1985/mdp).
